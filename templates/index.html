                    <h2>Trees, trams, change</h2>
                    <p>In February 2024, the City of Edinburgh Council proposed an extension to the existing tram network.
                        <br>
                         Much attention has since been drawn to the Roseburn Path – the favoured tramline would replace this ecological 
                         corridor and green space. 
                       <br>
                       <br>
                       Interested in the potential loss of trees, a team from the University of Edinburgh sought to quantify the carbon stock of the path. 
                       <br>
                       Adopting a ‘ground up’ approach, this first required estimating biomass at the individual tree level; 
                       the map below shows a subset of the trees sampled. A considerable range of species can be observed, 
                       with each map icon providing more information.

                        For viewing of specific biomass ranges, filtering is available in the top centre of the map.

                    <p>Using this field data, biomass estimations were upscaled to the entirety of the path. (For information around methodology, 
                        please refer to the <a href="{{ url_for('download_file', filename='roseburn_path_report.pdf') }}" download>formal report produced</a>). It is estimated the path contains <strong>1,469,366kg of biomass</strong>, 
                        equivalent to around <strong>734,683kg of carbon</strong>. 
                       <br>
                       <br>
                       These findings provide a valuable first insight. However, there is uncertainty to these results (found in the formal report). 
                       <br>
                       <br>
                       Estimations should also be placed in the broader context of reduced CO2 emissions from car travel. The team’s preliminary calculations suggest 
                       that around <strong> 3.07 million tram journeys </strong>(in place of car journeys) would negate this 735,000kg of carbon stock loss. 
                       For reference, <a href ="https://drscottarthur.scot/2024/01/30/whats-next-for-trams-in-edinburgh-orchard-brae-or-roseburn/" target="_blank">around 13.5 million trips </a>could be made on the new tram route every year.
